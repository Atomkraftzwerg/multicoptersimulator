The Visual Simulation Environment provides the graphic output of the simulation. In this window the camera views can be controlled, it is also possible to move the camera freely.

==Control window==

The control window allows to control the multicopter entity in the simulator. It is also possible to use a Xbox 360 gamepad. Automatic flight control with PID controllers can also be activated in this window.

==Simulator settings window==

In this window the options of the wind simulation and the multicopter type can be set.

==PID tuning window==

The program also provides simulated PID controllers on the multicopter. Autotuning wasn't implemented yet, so it is possible to manually tune the P, I and D values of the controllers in this window.

==Statistics window==
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15145382/Simulator%20Statistics.png
This window provides the recording of statistics of a set of values. Also a graphic plot output is given for the values. Furthermore some debug data is shown in this window
